# Hello-World
I'm figuring things out, okay?

I'm not very good at these things. Talking about myself and writing details about what im trying to do have never been my strong suit.
Maybe if I were writing a book..
That would be easier. My hamsters would probably end up as the main characters then.
I'm trying to figure out how to code so that I can go and get a job that is easier on me physically than most jobs that I can find at this time.
Perhaps I can write a book on the side.. just short stories, you know?
Well, I think ths is pretty good for my first entry to let you guys know a bit more about myself.
I can treat this like a not too personal diary.

Thanks!!
